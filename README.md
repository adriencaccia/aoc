# Advent of Code Solutions 🎄🎁🌟

Welcome to my Advent of Code Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, written in Rust and TypeScript.

## About the Project 📖

Advent of Code is an annual event where every day from December 1st to 25th, a new coding puzzle is released. Each puzzle has two parts, and they get progressively more difficult as the event goes on.

This project is my personal journey through these puzzles. I've chosen to solve them using Rust and TypeScript, two powerful and expressive languages that I enjoy working with.

## Repository Structure 🏗️

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory (e.g., `2021`, `2022`). Inside each year's directory, there is a `src` directory that contains a separate directory for each day's solutions (e.g., `day01`, `day02`).

The `utils` directory contains utility functions that are used across multiple solutions.

The `scripts` directory contains scripts for initializing new days.

The `template` directory contains templates for new days in both Rust and TypeScript.
